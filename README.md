### This repo is my Skills Based Assessment, SBA 308: JavaScript Fundamentals, for Per Scholas. We just ended our 4th week of the 16 week Software Development bootcamp. We had 2 days to complete this assessment.

This assessment is to gauge my understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts and my ability to apply these concepts in a practical manner. Specifically:

- Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.
- Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
- Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
- Develop functions to create reusable code.
- Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.
- Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.

 
### REFLECTION QUESTIONS:

What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

- I could have printed to given data out and reviewed it side by side. I could have drawn lines to connect the data from one array to another. I could have made a list or notes or psuedocoded what I needed to do before starting to code.


Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

- I had a lot of trouble comparing to arrays of objects and extracting data if they matched and putting that data into a new array of objects. If I would have planned it out first, I could have asked questions in office hours. By the time I knew I needed help it was the weekend so I stayed blocked for a long time and tried 100 different approaches (some twice because I forgot I tried that approach already) before I finally got a loop then .filter nested in a loop then .filter to work üòµ‚Äçüí´

What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?
If I had more time I would:

- FIX THIS BUG?: My code doesn't work if a learner has 2 of the same assignemnt ids (Is this a case?)
- Try to get a simplier approach to work not using .filter
- Get the assignment id key to be a number instead of a string (I could use +str and force it to be a number but I think I coded it incorrectly which is why its a string)
