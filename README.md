This repo is my Skills Based Assessment, SBA 308: JavaScript Fundamentals, for my Per Scholas bootcamp.

This assessment is to gauge my understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts and my ability to apply these concepts in a practical manner. Specifically:
-Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.
-Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
-Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
-Develop functions to create reusable code.
-Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.
-Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.

 We just ended our 4th week of the 16 week Software Development bootcamp. We had 2 days to complete this assessment. If I had more time I would:
-BUG: My code can't handle if a learner has 3 assignments
-Rename my variables so the code is more understandable 
-Try to break code up into helper functions 
-Try to get a simplier approach to work not using .filter
-Get the assingment id key to be a number instead of a string (I could use +str and force it to be a number but I think coded it incorrectly which is why its a string)
